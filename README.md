1.To make the app more secure I would have to take care of Authentication and Authorization e.g "Implement robust user authentication (using JWT, OAuth, or similar) and authorization to ensure that users can only access and modify their own notes.
Use role-based access control for different levels of user privileges.", Data Validation ,
Optimize the database schema and queries for performance. Code-wise I would have to use TypeScript, take care of Dependency Management, Environment
Variables.

2.Data Optimization e.g "Using indexing in the database to speed up query execution, especially for frequently accessed data like note titles or categories, Pagination and Lazy Loading e.g " I would implement pagination in the API to limit the number of records sent in a single response,
and I'd use lazy loading in the UI to load data as needed rather than all at once.", Code Optimization e.g "I would optimize the application code for performance. Avoid unnecessary computations and minimize complexity."
